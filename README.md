- Azure AD Authentication: Secure login with Microsoft Azure Active Directory
- Conversation History: Access and continue previous conversations

## Implementation Details
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Streamlit (frontend app - chatGPT style)
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL - if using authentication - optional)
- Azure AD application registration (if using authentication - optional)
- An Azure Function App as backend API endpoint
- CosmosDB to store user conversations and history

## Use Cases

### Insurance

- `Planner`: an orchestrator agent
- `CRM`: simulate fetching clients information from a CRM (DB, third-party API etc)
- `Policies RAG`: vector search with AI Search on various public available policy documents (product information)

### Banking

### Azure deployment (automated)

To configure, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you AZ CLI is logged in in the right tenant. Optionally:

    ```shell
    az login --tenant your_tenant.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

1. Create a new azd environment:

    ```shell
    azd env new
    ```

    This will create a folder under `.azure/` in your project to store the configuration for this deployment. You may have multiple azd environments if desired.

1. Set the `AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID` azd environment variable to the tenant ID you want to use for Entra authentication:

    ```shell
    azd env set AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID $(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
    ```

1. Login to the azd CLI with the Entra tenant ID:

    ```shell
    azd auth login --tenant-id $(azd env get-value AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID)
    ```

1. Proceed with AZD deployment:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

### Data indexing 
You can index your data located under the data folder by executing first the `data_upload.py` and then `data_indexing.py`:
```bash
python3 ./scripts/data_upload.py
python3 ./scripts/data_indexing.py
```
Each subfolder of the data folder will be a seperate index. 
If you are using managed identity make sure to assign the following roles to the AI Search: Cognitive Service OpenAI user, Storage Blob Data Reader.
Assign the following roles to the user (yourself): Cognitive Service OpenAI user, Storage Blob Data Contributor, Search Service Data Contributor and Search Service Contributor. 

### Docker deployment (local) - backend

The python project is managed by pyproject.toml and [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Install uv prior executing.

To run locally:
```shell
cd src/backend
uv sync
./.venv/bin/python app.py
```

### Docker deployment (local) - frontend

- create a .env file following the env.sample in the project frontend directory and set the following environment variables: 

Mandatory variables (use `DISABLE_LOGIN=True` for local dev and to bypass MSAL auth):
```
DISABLE_LOGIN=<Set to `True` to disable login>
```

For enabling auth you need to have an app registration:
```
AZ_REG_APP_CLIENT_ID=<Your Azure Registered App Client ID>
AZ_TENANT_ID=<Your Azure Tenant ID>
WEB_REDIRECT_URI=<Your Redirect URI>
```

### Running the App (local)

Start the Streamlit application:

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run rm_app.py
```

### Running the Backend Function App (local)

```bash
cd backend
func host start
```

### Usage

1. **Login**: Click on "Log in with Microsoft" to authenticate via Azure AD (automatically skipped if `DISABLE_LOGIN=True`)
2. **Select Use Case**: Choose between `fsi_insurance` and `fsi_banking` from the sidebar
3. **Start a Conversation**: Click "Start New Conversation" or select an existing one
4. **Chat**: Use the chat input to ask questions. Predefined questions are available in a dropdown
5. **Agents Online**: View the available agents for the selected use case
6. **Chat Histories**: View and reload your past conversations

### Somewhat useful commands

Cleaning up your application (WILL DELETE THE APP AND THE DATA):
```bash
azd down --purge --force
```

Delete the Azure Entra App Registration:
```bash
az ad app delete --id $(az ad app list --display-name $(azd env get-value AZURE_ENV_NAME) --query '[].id'  -o tsv)
```

Deleting all RBAC assignments:
```bash
for id in $(az role assignment list --all --query "[?contains(scope, '/rg-argus-005/')].{id:id}" -o tsv)
do 
  az role assignment delete --ids $id
done
```
(useful mostly when developing RBAC and the assignments are changing a lot)
